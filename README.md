# News-App-using-Android-Studio
I have made a News App using Java in Android Studio.This app shows the current news of India and keeps us updated with the current affairs.
I have used Retrofit Library to fetch the news article and show them in a recycler view.
There are 6 different categories of news - Health,Business,Science,Technology,Sports,Entertainment
User can click on a particular news category according to their choice
I have also implmeneted a search bar to search for a specific news article.
